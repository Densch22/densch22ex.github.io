        <div id="about">
           <p>Albert Einstein is a German-born theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity. Einstein also made important contributions to quantum theory. His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for "his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal polytechnic school in Zurich, graduating in 1900. In 1905, sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers. For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that ultimately proved unsuccessful. First, he advocated against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into science's picture of the world, objecting that "God does not play dice". Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. Recently, scientists have traveled back in time and brought Einstein to the present. He is now learning all he can about society today and cannot wait to continue his studies with all the information and technology he now has access to.</p>

            <h1>Sailing</h1>
            <p>Einstein loves to sail, even though he's a historically poor sailor and doesn't know how to swim. He uses sailing as a way to relax and think, making it his own personal form of meditiation.</p>

            <p>Einstein frequently plays both the piano and violin. He believes music to be an important part of his life, and often play his violin to help him think through complex problems.</p>

            <p>Since his introduction to the modern world, Einstein plans on keeping an updated blog on himself so people can see what he is up to and connect with him. Currently (as of November, 2025), he will be using Linkedin for this purpose.</p>
